# 🚦 DriveSafe: Integrated V2X and AI System for Complete Driver & Road Safety

A highly advanced graduation project that integrates **AI-powered driver monitoring** with **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication** and an **Automated Emergency Response System with Autonomous Control** to protect the driver, notify emergency services, and manage surrounding traffic.

## 🌟 System Pillars: Safety, Autonomy, and Cooperation

The DriveSafe system covers every phase of a critical incident, from detection to autonomous resolution, ensuring maximum safety for the driver and the surrounding vehicles.

| Feature Category | Description | Technical Implementation Highlight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🚨 Autonomous Takeover & Parking** | **CRITICAL SAFETY PROTOCOL:** If the driver is detected as unconscious or incapacitated, the system initiates **autonomous control**, maneuvering the vehicle to a **safe stop** and **parking it** out of traffic flow. | Required implementation of low-level **vehicle control commands** via the Carla API bridge. |
| **🗺️ Dynamic Traffic Re-routing** | Uses the V2V network to broadcast the location and status of the disabled vehicle. The system integrates with a mapping service to **re-calculate and suggest optimal routes** for other nearby drivers to avoid the hazard zone. | Integrated with a **Routing Service API** to dynamically inject a high-priority hazard avoidance zone. |
| **🧠 Multi-Model AI Monitoring** | Uses multiple **TFLite models** for real-time detection of fatigue, distraction (e.g., phone use), and head pose from the camera feed. | Achieved high FPS processing through optimized, concurrent ML model inference. |
| **🚑 Automated Emergency Response** | Triggers an immediate alert to **emergency services (Ambulance)** upon critical detection, transmitting the vehicle's **GPS coordinates**, physiological data, and driver ID. | Implemented the secure API call logic with precise geographic data transmission. |
| **V2V Proximity Alerts** | Peer-to-peer communication between DriveSafe-enabled vehicles to instantly share localized danger alerts (e.g., rapid braking, autonomous parking events). | Utilized `[...] MQTT / Wi-Fi Direct / other P2P protocol ...` for low-latency data exchange. |
| **⌚ Smart Watch Data Fusion** | Integrates physiological data (Heart Rate, HRV) with visual AI analysis to generate the final, weighted **Driver Safety Score**. | Developed a robust communication service (e.g., Bluetooth LE) for reliable wearable data acquisition. |
| **🕹️ Carla Simulation Integration** | All autonomous and communication features were validated within the **Carla Simulator** to prove safety and functionality under complex, dynamic, and critical driving scenarios. | Successfully established a stable, low-latency control and data bridge. |
